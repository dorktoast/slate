A practical system of tools for VRChat filmmakers

This prefab is the first in a set of teels I'm going to be creating to help VRChat filmmakers improve their works by adding some practical systems used in real-life filmmkaing. Please follow the project if you're interested in more!

Please support my work at: patreon.com/gibgames

You can also follow me on facebook, twitter, twitch, and tiktok at @dorktoast.
